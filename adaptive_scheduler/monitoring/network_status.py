'''
network_status.py - Retrieve and identify changes in the observing capabilities
                    of the network.

This module provides Network, an object that tracks the presence of Events
that affect telescope observing readiness. Helper methods allow comparison between
the state of the network last time, and the current state, allowing a client to
take action based on events appearing or disappearing.

Example usage:
    network = Network()
    events = network.update()    # Refresh and return the current network state

    ... (later)
    events = network.update()
    network.has_changed()  # Flag indicating network change since previous update
